/* Pseudocode - Activity Section
looping over each activity capturing in 'input' variable
does activity occur at the same day and time as activity that was just clicked?

1. match data dayandtime attribute to data dayandtime attribute the element that was just clicked 'input'
2. is the activity different than the activity just clicked?

Checked by seeing if the activity just clicked is not equal to the activity in the current loop iteration
Both conditions checked by single if statement using && operator
if both conditions are true then this activity needs to be disabled or enabled
depending on whether clicked activity was checked or unchecked

use if/else statement -
if clicked activity was checked, then set the matching activity element's 'disabled' to true
if clicked activity was unchecked, set matching activity element's 'disabled property to false'
